Please note that the cs1graphics module is distributed separately at
http://www.cs1graphics.org

This distribution is organized with a separate directory for the
code introduced in each chapter.  In some cases, relevant files are
duplicated in later chapters as they are imported for new examples.
However, we have not duplicated the Mastermind software from Chapter 7,
which is relied upon for the graphical version in Chapter 15, nor the
search engine software from Chapter 12, which is relied upon by the
WebEngine of Chapter 16.

Note that the first printing of the book contains several bugs in the
displayed code (most notably in Chapter 15).  Those mistakes are
discussed on the official errata list for the book and will be
corrected in the second printing.  In distributing the source code
electronically, we are providing the UPDATED versions of all programs.
