File: story

Peter and Stewie are two programmers working on an application.  Each is
assigned an equal part of the final product and they go their separate
ways.

Peter must read some data and then output some data.  He decides to
use the names "read" and "write" for the two functions that he will
create.

Stewie must also read some data and then output some data.  Without knowing
the function names that Peter has chosen, he uses "read" and "write" for
his function names.

When both have completed their part of the application, they both come 
together to create the main function that will call the functions that 
they created.  Because they both chose the same function names, one of 
them will be forced to change his function names to avoid a conflict.  
While this would not be too big of a deal with only two functions each 
involved, what if there were hundreds of functions written by dozens 
of programmers, with functions calling other functions, etc.?  What a 
mess that would be having to resolve all the name conflicts!

Well, luckily, Lois knew about namespaces and quickly solved their
problem.  She created a file called peter.h that defined a namespace for
Peter's functions.  She then created a file called stewie.h that defined
a namespace for Stewie's functions.  In the main function, it simply became
a matter of using the appropriate namespace so that the name conflicts
did not occur.  Peter was so happy he went to the Drunken Clam.
