Program: Prog4

The Graph class, and the program, Prog4, has been written in the c++ programming language.
To construct the program, simply type in "make" into the command
line.  Type in "prog4" to execute the program.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Graph class is an Abstract Data Type that represents pathed graphs
(which are studied within Discrete mathematics).  They can be DIRECTED,
UNDIRECTED, WEIGHTED, or UNWEIGHTED.  No limit of vertices can be added,
as well as edges.

PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program relies on 2 files to exist:

File                   function                description
____________________   _____________________   _______________________________
main.cpp               main                    main function
graph.h                Graph defenition &      graph templated class
                       implementation

The directory also has two miscellaneous files for user convienience:
File                            description
____________________            ______________________________________________
makefile                        compiles all files into usable program
README                          provides program information (this file)
finalTest.cpp                   Advanced testing meant to try and break the
                                 class.
Graph_Nodetypes                 Provides a visual approach to interperting
                                 the structure of the class.

PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>main.cpp finalTest.cpp, graphmain.cpp and  is meant to fully test the class,
any bugs that have been found within those files have been eradicated.

Known bugs:
When dumping in UNDIRECTED, there will be double the amount of edges listed
than what the program sais there is, because when things are directed, it's
assumed that one edge can go 'both ways'.  This isn't a bug, but it could 
have the potential to make me lose points.  You should be able to delete
these double-sided edges by inputting them in any order of paramaters.
An error will be thrown if you try to insert the same double sided edges
if it already exists.

Likewise, in a DIRECTED graph, you will be able to insert similar edges
by reversing the paramaters.  An error will be thrown if you try to delete
the edges.  The amount of edges being dumped will be matched exactly to how
many are reported.  Reasoning behind this would be if a different weight
is needed by going in "opposite directions".  Again, these aren't bugs, but
these issues should be addressed.
