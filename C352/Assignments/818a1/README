INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Money class is a class intended to assist in outputting
in various formats.

PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program relies on 3 files to exist:

File                   function                description
____________________   _____________________   _______________________________
main.cpp               main                    main function
money.cpp              Implementation          contains the money class
money.h                Defenition              defenition of the money class

The directory also has two miscellaneous files for user convienience:
File                            description
____________________            ______________________________________________
makefile                        compiles all files into usable program
README                          provides program information (this file)

PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>Checked negative number of all three outputs
>Made sure everything lined up correctly

Known bugs:
Various formats for extra credit were started, but not finished.
There is a private method to assist in extra credit formats,
but there is a weird bug for it when you output values.
