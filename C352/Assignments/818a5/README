Program: Prog4

The SortedList class, and the program, Prog5, has been written in the c++ programming language.
To construct the program, simply type in "make" into the command
line.  Type in "prog4" to execute the program.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SortedList class is an Abstract Data Type that is-a list (from the Standard
Template Library).  It automatically sorts it's contents as well as gives
additional (and optional) approaches to traversing the list.

The file main.cpp fully gives an example of the SortedList in use.

PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program relies on 2 files to exist:

File                   function                description
____________________   _____________________   _______________________________
main.cpp               main                    main function
sortedlist.h         SortedList defenition &   sortedlist templated class
                       implementation

The directory also has two miscellaneous files for user convienience:
File                            description
____________________            ______________________________________________
makefile                        compiles all files into a usable program
README                          provides program information (this file)

PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>main.cpp is meant to provide a solid example of how the class works.
It has been edited several times to test the limits of the class, but has
been restored to it's original form.
