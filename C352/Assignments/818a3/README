Program: Prog3

The Array class, and the program, Prog3, has been written in the c++ programming language.
To construct the program, simply type in "make" into the command
line.  Type in "prog3" to execute the program.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Array class is meant to be an advanced array class giving programmers
who use it the opportunity to use alternate methods of accessing indeces.

PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program relies on 2 files to exist:

File                   function                description
____________________   _____________________   _______________________________
main.cpp               main                    main function
array.h                Array defenition &      array templated class
                       implementation

The directory also has two miscellaneous files for user convienience:
File                            description
____________________            ______________________________________________
makefile                        compiles all files into usable program
README                          provides program information (this file)

PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>main.cpp is meant to fully test the class, any bugs have been found and
eradicated with that file

Known bugs:
No known bugs
