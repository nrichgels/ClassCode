This directory gives a heap ADT.  I got this code from a previous
data structures textbook.

I added a method to the heap class called dump that will simply
dump out the array contents of the heap.  This is for demonstration
purposes only to show the contents of the heap following each
change to the heap, insertion or deletion.
