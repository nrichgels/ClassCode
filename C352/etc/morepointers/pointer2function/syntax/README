This directory contains 5 examples.

ex1.cpp
   * Uses a typedef to create a name for the pointer to the function.
     This makes usage of pointers to functions much more readable.
   * A key point to keep in mind that a pointer to a function must have
     the signature of the function (the return type and parameters).
   * This example also shows passing a pointer to a function as a parameter.

ex2.cpp
   * Similar to ex1.cpp except the pointer to a function has a different
     signature.

ex3.cpp
   * Again, just a different function signature.

ex4.cpp
   * This example does not use a typedef.  The readability of the code
     is not as clear without the typedef.

ex5.cpp
   * This gives an example of having a pointer to a templated function.
     I'm not so sure how useful something like this would be.
