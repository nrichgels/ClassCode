This example contains a compiler error.  The compiler error occurs because
main.cpp includes the following:
#include "circle.h"
#include "prototypes.h"

prototypes.h also includes circle.h resulting in redefinition compiler
errors since the contant PI would be declared twice as would the
Circle class.

To prevent the compiler error, all .h files should be surrounded by
#ifndef _PickYourSymbol_
#define _PickYourSymbol_
   // put the good stuff here
#endif

This means that if the symbol is not defined, define it and include
the code in between.  Or put the other way, if it is defined, ignore the
code in between because it's already been defined.

The symbol you pick should not be used anywhere else.
