This example contains a linker error.  The linker error occurs because
the implementation for the Circle class is contained in the same file
(circle.h) with the definition (specification).  Since both main.cpp 
and func.cpp both include circle.h, they compile correctly but a linker
error occurs due to a multiple definition of each method.  In other
words, when main.o and func.o are linked together, they both contain
the Circle class implementation.

To prevent a linker error, the class must be compiled separately with
circle.h including only the definition (specification) that is included
by main.cpp and func.cpp.
