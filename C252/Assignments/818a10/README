Program: Prog9

The program, Prog10, has been written in the c++ programming language.
To construct the program, simply type in "make" into the command
line.  Simply type in "prog10" into the command line to run the program
correctly.


INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prog 10 is a program intended to test the converter class.

I/O
~~~
Regarding Input:
There is no input for the program.

Regarding Output:
The output that is displayed will be testing the two methods of the converter
class.


PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prog10 relies on four files to exist:
File                           function                  description
___________________       ___________________          _________________
converter.cpp             class converter         Provides defenition for the
                                                        converter class

converter.h               class converter         Provides implementation for
                                                     the converter class

stackType.h            template class stackType     Provides defenition and
                                                     implementation for the
                                                       the stackType class

main.cpp                       main                 Tests the class via output

This directly also has two files for conveinience:
File                             description
___________________________      ________________________________________
makefile                         compiles all files into a usable program
README                           provides program information (this file)



PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please note that this program has been tested assuming that all input 
has been given with the proper format. For more information on the 
input's proper format, please read the I/O section.

>Tested the converter class's ability to change into other bases.
>Tested the converter class's ability to change negative integers.
>Tested the converter class's ability to 'change' a base into the same base.

Though no bugs were found, I still have a full can of bugspray.
