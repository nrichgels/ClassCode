Class: Rectangle
Program: Prog6

The Rectangle Class and the program Prog6 have been written in the c++
programming language.  To construct the program, simply type in "make"
into the command line.  Simply type in "prog6" into the command line to run
the program.

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rectangle is a class intended to replicate the theorems of a rectangle.
Prog6 is a program solely intended for testing the class, and providing an
example of how it is used.

I/O
~~~
The Rectangle class is completely useable with all boolean operators.
When a boolean operator is used to compare rectangles, the rectangle's area
is considered.

The Rectangle class has 7 different methods for a programmer to use.

  Method                         Description                       C/M/A
  ______                         ___________                       _____
Rectangle(length, width)     Creates a Rectangle Object         Constructor
setLength(double)          Sets the length of Rec. Object         Mutator
setWidth(double)           Sets the width of Rec. Object          Mutator
Width()                    Returns the width of Rec. Object       Accessor
Length()                  Returns the length of Rec. Object       Accessor
Area()                     Returns the area of Rec. Object        Accessor
Perimeter()               Returns the Perimeter of Rec. Object    Accessor

Since Rectangle is a constructor, you initialize an object with it.
Ex:
Rectangle Object(4, 16) <-- Object is a Rectangle with length 4 & width 16.

Everything else is a method you can do with that object.
Ex:
Object.setWidth(10) <-- Width is changed from 16 to 10
Object.Area() <-- Returns the area, which is 4*10 = 40

PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class relies on 2 files to exist:

File               Description
_________________  ____________________________
rectangle.cpp      Implementation of Rectangle class
rectangle.h        Definition(specification) of Rectangle Class

The directory also has three miscellanious files for user convienience

File               Description
_________________  ____________________________
main.cpp           Tests and examplifies the Rectangle class in Prog6
makefile           Compiles and Links Prog6
README             Provides class & program informatin (this file)

The Rectangle class can be given a width and length, and it can return
the width, length, area, and perimeter of that rectangle.

PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please note that this program has been tested assuming that all input
has been given with the proper format.  For more information on the
input's proper format, please read the I/O section.

All operations and methods have been thoroughly tested (via main.cpp).

Though no known bugs were found, I still have a full can of bugspray.
So if you find a bug, contact me at "richgelsna@mnstate.edu".
