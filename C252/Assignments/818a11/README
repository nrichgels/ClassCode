Program: Prog9

The program, Prog11, has been written in the c++ programming language.
To construct the program, simply type in "make" into the command
line.  Type in "prog11", followed by an inputfile, followed by
the file that you want the output written out to.


INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prog11 is a program intended to read a phrase from a file and output
whether or not it's a palindrome.

I/O
~~~
Regarding Input:
A textfile of the user's choice.  The user should include an argument in the
command line with a textfile that has at least one phrase ending with a '.'.
The last two characters of the file should be a '.' followed by a '\n'.

Regarding Output:
All output is written to the third argument of the command line.  It will
be every phrase, followed by whether or not that phrase or word is a 
palindrome.


PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prog11 relies on six files to exist:
File                           function                  description
___________________       ___________________          _________________
functions.cpp             function implementation      Provides functons
                                                           for main

prototypes.h               function defenition         Provides function
                                                              headers.

stackType.h             template class stackType     Provides defenition and
                                                      implementation for the
                                                         stackType class

queueType.h             template class queueType     Provides defenition and
                                                      implementation for the
                                                         queuetype class

constants.h                  constants              Holds used in the program

main.cpp                       main                 Tests the class via output

This directly also has two files for conveinience:
File                             description
___________________________      ________________________________________
makefile                         compiles all files into a usable program
README                           provides program information (this file)



PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please note that this program has been tested assuming that all input 
has been given with the proper format. For more information on the 
input's proper format, please read the I/O section.

>Tested 'uneven' capitals.
>Tested 'uneven' spaces.
>Tested ignorable punctuation.
>Tested long strings.
>Tested multiple palindromes.

Known bugs:  While loop in main continues even though eof.
