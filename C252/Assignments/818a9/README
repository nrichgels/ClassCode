Program: Prog9

The program, Prog9, has been written in the c++ programming language.
To construct the program, simply type in "make" into the command
line.  Simply type in "prog9" and a complementery file into the 
command line to run the program correctly. (The "complementery file"
will be explained later in this file)


INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prog 9 is a program intended to read a given file with names and
birthdates entered into it, and output the age of each person in
organized columns.

I/O
~~~
Regarding Input:
The user should put the names & birthdays of people into a text file
without any extensions.  When running the program, the text file
should be typed in after the prog9 (seperated by a whitespace).
For every person that has an age to be expressed, there should
be an entry in the text file in this format:
name
mm/dd/yyyy

For example:

Johnny Man
1/2/1960
Mary Woman
3/4/1965

For the program to work properly, make sure to include EVERY piece
of information in the correct format for each person.

*Note: There's a maximum number of 100 people that can be
interpreted at a time by the program.

Regarding Output:
The output will be displayed in the Command Line that tells you the
name and age of each person.  It should be in a format like the
following:

Name                      Age
_________________________ ___
Johnny Man                 52
Mary Woman                 47


PROGRAM DESIGN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prog9 relies on seven files to exist:
File                           function                  description
___________________       ___________________          _________________
arrayListType.h           class arrayListType     Provides defenition for the
                                                      arrayListType class
arrayListTypeImp.cpp      class arrayListType     Provides implementation for
                                                    the arrayListType class
date.cpp                  class Date              Provides implementation for
                                                        the Date class
date.h                    class Date              Provides defenition for the
                                                         Date class
itemtype.h                class Person            Provides defenition for the
                                                         Person class
person.cpp                class Person            Provides implementation for
                                                       the Person class
main.cpp                  main                     Manipulates objects made
                                                          from classes

This directly also has two files for conveinience:
File                             description
___________________________      ________________________________________
makefile                         compiles all files into a usable program
README                           provides program information (this file)

Finally, this program relies on one file built by other means to 
correctly function.


PROGRAM TESTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pleasen note that this program has been tested assuming that all input 
has been given with the proper format. For more information on the 
input's proper format, please read the I/O section.

>Made sure that the age was correct down to the day.
>Confirmed that the list stacked correctly.

Though no bugs were found, I still have a full can of bugspray.
